### Description
This is an API to get the name associated with a Lund University StiL. The database contains about 113000 rows and was last updated 2023-05-11 meaning if you were registered later your entry will not exist.

### Why
During development of an app we wanted to use StiL to limit users to Lund University and also tie the account to their name. You could then send an email to confirm to the account.
